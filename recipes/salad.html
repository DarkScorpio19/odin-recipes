			This salad is an all-veggie version of a cobb salad. It’s packed with
			fresh summer corn, crispy cucumbers, zucchini and the first of the
			seasons’ cherry tomatoes. I made a creamy vegan cashew-based
			“buttermilk-like” dressing and coconut “bacon.” It’s a lot of quotation
			marks for one meal, but I promise (whether you’re vegan or not) you’re
			going to love it.

		<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><em>1 small head romaine lettuce, chopped</em></li>
			<li><em>½ cup halved cherry tomatoes</em></li>
			<li><em>1 small cucumber, thinly sliced</em></li>
			<li><em>1 medium zucchini, spiralized or peeled into ribbons</em></li>
			<li><em>1 ear of corn, grilled, kernels sliced off cobb</em></li>
			<li><em>1 avocado, pitted and diced</em></li>
			<li><em>12 to 14 ounces extra-firm tofu, patted dry and cubed</em></li>
			<li><em>½ cup coconut “bacon” (recipe below)</em></li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Coconut “Bacon”</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><em>1½ cups unsweetened coconut flakes</em></li>
			<li><em>1½ tablespoons tamari</em></li>
			<li><em>scant 1 tablespoon maple syrup</em></li>
			<li><em>½ teaspoon smoked paprika</em></li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Cashew “Buttermilk” Dressing: (this makes extra)</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				1 cup raw cashews, soaked in water 3 to 4 hours, preferably overnight,
				drained and rinsed
			</li>
			<li>½ to ¾ cups fresh water</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
			<li>¼ teaspoon onion powder</li>
			<li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
			<li>¼ to ½ teaspoon sea salt</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				In a blender, combine the cashews, ½ cup water, lemon juice, onion
				powder, garlic powder and ¼ teaspoon of sea salt. Blend until creamy,
				adding more water if necessary. Taste and season with additional salt as
				needed. Chill until ready to use.
			</li>
			<li>
				Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
				Place the coconut flakes along with the tamari, maple syrup and smoked
				paprika on the pan and toss gently to coat. Spread in a thin layer on
				the pan and bake until dark golden brown and slightly crispy, about 10
				minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Increase the oven temperature to 400°F and line a baking sheet with
				parchment paper. Place the tofu cubes on the pan and toss with a drizzle
				of olive oil and generous pinches of salt. Bake for 15 to 17 minutes or
				until golden brown around the edges.
			</li>
			<li>
				In a serving bowl, assemble the salad with the romaine, cherry tomatoes,
				cucumber, zucchini, corn, avocado and tofu. Top with the coconut “bacon”
				and serve with the dressing on the side. Store any extra dressing in a
				sealed container in the fridge.
			</li>
